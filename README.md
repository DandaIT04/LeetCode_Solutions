Decided to include my solutions for leetcode problems.

# LeetCode # 1 TwoSum

First leetcode problem and it was kind of a struggle. This is because at first i tried to ensure the number from the array cannot be larger than target number however my thoughts were invalid as negative numbers do exist in this problem. Even though i found this out, reduced a few lines of codes and ended up with a successful submission, it is still inefficient.

# Next LeetCode when?
