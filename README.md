# LeetCode_Solutions
Decided to include my solutions for leetcode problems.

# LeetCode # 1 TwoSum

First leetcode problem and it was kind of a struggle. This is because at first i tried to ensure the number from the array cannot be larger than target number however my thoughts were invalid as negative numbers do exist in this problem. Even though i found this out, reduced a few lines of codes and ended up with a successful submission, it is still inefficient.

# LeetCode # 9 Palindrome Number

Took much longer than it could have been because codeforces and leetcode solutions are different. Codeforces require manual inputs while leetcode doesn't hence, if my provided solutions are with the mentality of codeforces solutions, leetcode solution checking will return errors

# Next LeetCode when?
